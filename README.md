# Welcome to FooBar Social Network (Web version)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project
#### NOTE: As allowed in the 'Forum' of this exercise, we used hardcoded details to 'login' to the program.
The hardcoded details are:
- Username: TzionMea
- password: Mea100100

### Now, how it works?
1. Clone the project from the github and unzip it.
2. Navigate to the root folder of the project and run the command 'npm install' (this command will install all the necessary dependencies to the project based on the 'devDependencies' and the 'dependencies' sections in the package.json file).
3. If from some reason, it failed to install the necessary dependencies, you can install them manually by this command (that will install all the 'dependencies'):
npm install @testing-library/jest-dom@^5.17.0 @testing-library/user-event@^13.5.0 bootstrap@^5.3.2 react@^18.2.0 react-bootstrap@^2.10.0 react-dom@^18.2.0 react-router-dom@^6.22.0 react-scripts@5.0.1 web-vitals@^2.1.4
And then this command (that will install all the 'devDependencies'):
npm install @babel/preset-react@^7.23.3 @testing-library/dom@^9.3.4 @testing-library/react@^14.2.1 jest@^27.5.1 --save-dev
4. To run the program, make sure that you are on the 'root' folder of the project and run the command 'npm start'
5. To run the tests, run the command 'npm test' (if it doesnt runs the test click 'a' and this should run all the tests).
6. To get to the 'Feed' page, you first need to login with the provided hardcoded details.
7. You can sign up with any (VALID) details as you wish, for now, they arent save so you won't be able to login with them.
8. Now, all you need to do is enjoy FooBar :).



## About our work:


#### Firstly:
- We looked at the UI of the relevant Facebook pages that needs to be cloned.
- We Drawed a clone of the pages.
- We started to create the react files (without components).

#### Secondly:
- After we created the first sketch of the pages, we decided how to 'split' it to components.
- We then splitted the files to components and rendered them in the 'parent' components.
- We added styles to the pages.
- We added functionality to the pages (add posts, edit, add comments, edit, buttons and etc).

#### Thirdly:
- We modified the styles to handle dynamically resize of the screen.
- We wrote 6 tests to check Visual changes and functions as well.

#### Lastly:
- We made last modifications in the styles.
- We ENJOYED to use our program as users.
- And of course, we submitted the completed project.
